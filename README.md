<h3>🛠️ About me</h3>
<p>Crafting code since 2016, currently working as a Software Engineer <a href="https://www.rgspartners.com.br" target="_blank"><strong>@RGS Partners</strong></a>, making finance just a little bit high-tech everyday 😄<br>Also a part of <a href="">Team Micras</a>, my bachelor's thesis that also happens to be a competitive Micro Mouse.<br><br> Fluent in <strong>React ⚛️</strong>, <strong>Python 🐍</strong>, <strong>Ruby ♦️</strong>, and currently trying to wrap my head around <strong>Haskell</strong></p>

<h3>🚧 What's Cooking?</h3>
<p>Currently tinkering with: <a href="https://github.com/Matheus3007/crypt-of-the-cartomancer" target="_blank"><strong>Crypt of the Cartomancer</strong></a></p>
<p>Here's the scoop: It's actually an assignment for a game dev class I'm taking this semester, the page is poorly documented right now, but when the game gets done I'll document it and also publish it somewhere. The game is supposed to be a mix of Gungeon with Balatro and Vampire Survivors</p>

<h3>🎉 Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>Most of my work is under NDA's, but I really like this project I made for uni: <a href="https://github.com/Matheus3007/ElfViewer" target="_blank"><strong>ElfViewer</strong></a></p>
<p>As the title suggest, it's an interactive visualizer made in Python that takes in ARM ELF files from the disassembler and renders them with each pixel as a different colored instruction.<br>It was pretty fun to make and it also has a few different features that help understand how things work at a lower level (i.e. a branch indicator for branch instructions)<br>
It can also create some pretty fun wallpapers, such as this Biblically Accurate image of Tux' soul I made from a Linux ARM build:
