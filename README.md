<h3>🚧 What's Cooking?</h3>
<p>Currently tinkering with: <a href="https://github.com/Matheus3007/monospace-dreams" target="_blank"><strong>Monospace Dreams</strong></a></p>
<p>Here's the scoop: A personal page I'm working on just for fun, I've been around for way too long to not have my own website portfolio (but it has a cool twist)</p>

<h3>🎉 Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>Most of my work is under NDA's, but I really like this project I made for uni: <a href="https://github.com/Matheus3007/ElfViewer" target="_blank"><strong>ElfViewer</strong></a></p>
<p>As the title suggest, it's an interactive visualizer made in Python that takes in ARM ELF files from the disassembler and renders them with each pixel as a different colored instruction.<br>It was pretty fun to make and it also has a few different features that help understand how things work at a lower level (i.e. a branch indicator for branch instructions)<br>
It can also create some pretty fun wallpapers, such as this Biblically Accurate image of Tux' soul I made from a Linux ARM build:
